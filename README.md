# Y-HaploGroup Population Browser

## About
In human genetics, the haplogroups most commonly studied are Y-chromosome (Y-DNA) haplogroups and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplogroups, both of which can be used to define genetic populations. Y-DNA is passed solely along the patrilineal line, from father to son, while mtDNA is passed down the matrilineal line, from mother to offspring of both sexes. Pre-built jar file is available in [releases](https://github.com/fiidau/Y-HaploGroup-Population-Browser/releases/latest).

This software allows browsing and reporting of different population and their Y-chromosome (Y-DNA) haplogroups similarities and comparisons. All details are collected from Wikipedia and the reference for it will be available on the Wikipedia page.
